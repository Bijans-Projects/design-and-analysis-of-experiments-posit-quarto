## Welcome

This site is my published record of work for **STAT 4240 (Experimental Design)**.  
It’s intentionally **transparent and verbose** — the goal is to show not only *what* I did, but *how* I thought about it.

- **Assignments** are the polished deliverables
- **Explorations** are my chapter-by-chapter notes, exercises, and experiments
- Wherever possible, I include assumptions, diagnostics, and interpretations in plain language

## Working principles

- **Reproducibility:** code + narrative + outputs in one place  
- **Assumptions first:** what needs to be true for conclusions to be valid  
- **Checks:** diagnostics, sensitivity, and limitations are part of the work  
- **Clarity:** results are written for humans, not just for grading
